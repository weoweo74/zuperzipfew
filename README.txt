Health sector is one of the many sectors of standard administratively governed entity (Country or State), lack of detailed information in addition to where and how to reach a particular hospital is scantily available online and on your apple IOS or android mobile phones. However most of the currently existing information today lacks the key attributes or characteristics required to guide individual choice to visit a particular hospital. A recent public opinion gathered have shown that based on personal attributes of every person, which is linked to his/her religion, cultural, ethnic, socio-economic and geographical affiliation, a prior knowledge of detailed hospital information availability on their mobile devices can often be described as a stitch in time that saves nine. 
The concept of designing and deploying a solution based platform by relying on existing historical public and private hospital database , coupled with continuous crowdsourcing, web-scraping efforts and collaboration with local stakeholders in every country or province to further validate and ensure quality utilization of information as needed.
A newly deployed healthservicability map locator will enable users to discover the nearest hospital, its contact details, and the type of services will be known. It will provide to every individual a summary of any hospital attributes in other to allow a free and final choice of visiting any hospital based on a satisfactory information provided by the healthservicability mapping platform on your mobile device.
